# Excess Deaths During the Coronavirus Pandemic

The New York Times is releasing data that documents the number of deaths from all causes that have occurred during the coronavirus pandemic for 32 countries. We are compiling this time series data from national and municipal health departments, vital statistics offices and other official sources in order to better understand the true toll of the pandemic and provide a record for researchers and the public.

Official Covid-19 death tolls offer a limited view of the impact of the outbreak because they often exclude people who have not been tested and those who died at home. All-cause mortality is widely used by demographers and other researchers to understand the full impact of deadly events, including epidemics, wars and natural disasters. The totals in this data include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated or did not seek treatment for other conditions. 

We have used this data to produce [graphics tracking](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html) [the oubreak’s toll](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/10/world/coronavirus-history.html) and stories about [the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html), [Ecuador](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/americas/ecuador-deaths-coronavirus.html), [Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-deaths-moscow.html), [Turkey](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/middleeast/coronavirus-turkey-deaths.html), [Sweden](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-deaths.html) and [other countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/world/americas/latin-america-virus-death.html). We would like to thank a number of demographers and other researchers, listed at the end, who have provided data or helped interpret it.

## Country and City-Level Data

The number of all-cause deaths recorded in each area, by week or month, can be found in the **[deaths.csv](deaths.csv)** file. ([Raw CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/excess-deaths/deaths.csv)) For weekly data, the first and last weeks of the year, which are often partial weeks, were excluded.

```
country,placename,frequency,start_date,end_date,year,month,week,deaths,expected_deaths,excess_deaths,baseline
France,,weekly,2020-04-27,2020-05-03,2020,4,18,10498,10357,141,2010-2018 weekly average
```

Some of the data is only available at the city level.

```

Turkey,Istanbul,weekly,2020-04-06,2020-04-12,2020,4,15,2193,1429,764,2018-2019 weekly average
```


The deaths fields have the following definitions:

**deaths**: The total number of confirmed deaths recorded from any cause.  
**expected_deaths**: The baseline number of expected deaths, calculated from a historical average. See [expected deaths](#expected-deaths).  
**excess_deaths**: The number of deaths minus the expected deaths.  

The time fields have the following definitions:

**frequency**: Weekly or monthly, depending on how the data is recorded.  
**start_date**: The first date included in the period.  
**end_date**: The last date included in the period.  
**month**: Numerical month.  
**week**: Epidemiological week, which is a standardized way of counting weeks to allow for year-over-year comparisons. Most countries start epi weeks on Mondays, but others vary.  
**baseline**: The years used to calculate expected_deaths.  

## Methodology

The data is the product of journalists in a number of countries who monitor official data releases and ask government officials for information. We have consulted with demographers, medical officials and local sources to confirm that this data is broadly representative of how many people have died. In some countries, the number of burials, hospital deaths or other factors are used to confirm that the underlying trends are representative.

But mortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. Many countries have not yet published any data on all-cause mortality. And during a pandemic, normal patterns of death registration may be disrupted, which could lead to changes in how many deaths are captured. 

Most of the countries in this dataset have widespread vital statistics coverage. But many low-income countries have [unreliable death registration systems](https://twitter.com/helleringer143/status/1261868447903948800), making it very difficult to assess their levels of excess mortality. A rough guide to the historical completeness of death registration systems by country is available from the United Nations:
https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/crvs/documents/Website_final_coverage.xls

Some countries are publishing mortality data faster than normal in order to understand how mortality is changing. That means data, especially for recent time periods, may be revised. It is usually revised upwards as more deaths are reported.

Expected deaths  for [the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html) were calculated with a simple model based on the number of all-cause deaths from 2015 to 2019 released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adjusted to account for trends, like population changes, over time.

Our analysis aims to show mortality statistics for as much of the country as possible, but it is limited to those states where mortality data is sufficiently complete.

Some states are so far behind in submitting death certificates to the C.D.C. that the C.D.C. does not recommend relying on their recent death reporting. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, for example, death reporting seems to be lagging far behind the normal rate all year, according to the C.D.C., even though their reporting is usually more timely, so we have excluded data from those states, in addition to Alaska, Connecticut, Louisiana, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and West Virginia.

See [Data Sources](#data-sources) below for the source of data for each country and city in this dataset.

## Expected Deaths

We have calculated an average number of expected deaths for each area based on historical data for the same time of year. These expected deaths are the basis for our [excess death calculations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html), which estimate how many more people have died this year than in an average year.

To estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to the reported deaths in each country from earlier years to January 2020. The model has two components — a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than using a smoothing spline. 

The number of expected deaths are not adjusted for how non-Covid-19 deaths may change during the outbreak, which will take some time to figure out. As countries impose control measures, deaths from causes like road accidents and homicides may decline. And people who die from Covid-19 cannot die later from [other causes](https://twitter.com/AndrewNoymer/status/1241620305350549504), which may reduce other causes of death. Both of these factors, if they play a role, would lead these baselines to understate, rather than overstate, the number of excess deaths.

The number of years used in the expected deaths calculation changes depending on what data is available. See Data Sources for the years used to calculate the baselines.
